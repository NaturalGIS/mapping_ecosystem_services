**Description:**
This "Mapping Biocontrol Ecosystem Services" QGIS plugin was developed by the University of Évora to map the biocontrol services that species occuring in natural and semi-natural habitats provide to agricultural areas. It calculates the overall biocontrol services provided by the natural habitat patches within a determined distance from the agricultural area. The biocontrol services provided can be distance weighted according to a linear decay function or a half-normal decay function. This plugin was developed within the University of Évora (Portugal) within the project "New tools for monitoring ecosystems services in traditional Alentejo production systems under intensification" (ALT20-03-0145-FEDER-000008), co-funded by Alentejo 2020, Portugal 2020 and European Fund for Regional Development.
